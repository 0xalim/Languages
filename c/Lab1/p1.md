* Question: What happens in the following line of code? Why is this
incorrect?

```C
x_ptr = 17;
```

Assuming we want the variable `x_ptr` to be a pointer instead of just giving
the value. Should instead be `*x_ptr = 17`.

* Task: Explain the effect of the following lines of code. Explain the
left-hand side and right-hand side of each assignment. Describe the
data-types and values of the three variables x, p, and q.

```C
int x = 2;
int* p = *x;
int** q = &p;
```

Line1:
1. Datatype: integer
1. Variable named x
1. Holds the value 2

Line2:
1. Datatype: integer pointer
1. Variable named p
1. Holds value of whatever x is pointing to

Line3:
1. Datatype: Double integer pointer
1. Variable named q
1. Points to the address of p
