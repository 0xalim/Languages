Quick refresher on HTML as we've started doing web exploitation in
my 474 course (/courses/cps474). Thought why not review a couple of
basic web stuff and this included some HTML review. Definitely learned
a few new things since last time i've done HTML was... never. Really easy,
to use and understand. Good logical flow of things from the few things that
have been introduced in this part.

*Good work Tim Berners-Lee, and others.*
