Quick refresher on HTML as we've started doing web exploitation in
my 474 course (/courses/cps474). Thought why not review a couple of
the basics, this includes:

1. HTML
1. JS
1. NodeJS

I assume we will be using nodeJS as our server-side language in the
labs and assignments. Not sure yet as we've also done mostly PHP 
up till now. Who cares though, all for fun.
