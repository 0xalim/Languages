# Javascript

```
Javascripting content from @workshopper
Functional-javascript-workshop from @timoxley
```

First time learninig Javascript hands-on like this. Super easy syntax,
really familar since i've done mostly java due to course work. Javascripting
is really a bit too simple and easy, need a bit more micro-project kind of 
work to learn more about the language and why this is the most used language
for web based stuff.
